# About COS 760 – Natural Language Processing for Data Scientists

COS 760 is an Honours-level course offered by the Department of Computer Science at the University of Pretoria. It equips students with foundational and advanced knowledge of Natural Language Processing (NLP), spanning classical statistical methods to contemporary deep learning and transformer-based approaches. The course covers key NLP tasks such as language modeling, sentiment analysis, machine translation, named entity recognition, and automatic speech recognition. Students engage with both theory and practice, applying techniques using Python and frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Huggingface.

A distinguishing feature of COS 760 is its focus on contextually relevant NLP. Students are encouraged to center their projects around African languages and low-resource contexts, aligning with the broader goals of ethical, inclusive, and socially impactful AI. Through lectures, tutorials, continuous assessments, and a collaborative final project, the course fosters both technical rigor and thoughtful application in real-world settings—particularly in domains critical to African societies.
